# EarthQuakes

A simple command-line program to search and filter earthquakes that occurred in the past seven days as reported on the [earthquake.usgs.gov](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) website.

## Running the program

Download the [`EarthQuakeSearcher.jar`](https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/EarthQuakes/blob/master/EarthQuakeSearcher.jar) file and run it from the command line with `java -jar EarthQuakeSearcher.jar outputFile.txt`, designating an output file to print results. 

#### <u>What I Learned</u>

- Defined and implemented interfaces to remove redundancies in code
- Dynamic dispatching
- Implemented several sorting algorithms from scratch
- Wrote classes that implement the Comparator interface to sort by various criteria
